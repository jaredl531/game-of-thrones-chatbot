# Game of Thrones Chatbot
A simple UI and chatbot to help answer many Game of Thrones-related inquiries! The code uses PubNub's API to publish and subscribe to the chats and a dataset from @jeffreylancaster to search and lookup all of the data. You can view some more of his awesome GoT datasets and visualizations [here]( https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones).

## How to get started
The code is completely client-side so all you'll need to do is download the repo, throw it in a cloud folder and call index.html. You'll probably want to generate your own [PubNub API Keys](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/pubnub-rest-api-documentation) for this so that you can view all chats in your own, personal console.

A live demo can also be found [here](https://jared-hack-projects.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/game-of-thrones-chat/index.html) if you want to see it in action right away.

## Usage

The chatbot has been preloaded with the ability to answer questions about the following categories. Note that either first names, first + last names or even nicknames (e.g. The Hound) can be recognized usually.
